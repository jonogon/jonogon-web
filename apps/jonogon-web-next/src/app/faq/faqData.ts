      question: "How exactly did 2500+ Citizen Join Forces?",
      answer: "During the afterman of August 5th, a call went out to gather the tech community to really build Bangladesh 2.0 - with tools and products so that will ensure that what happened that day, doesn't ever/can't ever happen again. Inspired by it's open-source approach - a community of 2500 people from all over Bangladesh and the world formed overnight - with engineers, product managers, designers, artists, entrepreneurs, media personalities, lawyers and more. Everyone wanted to come together - and build together - the future of Bangladesh."

    {
      question: "How does the platform exactly work?",
      answer: `The petition process works as follows:
  
  - Submit your দাবি
  - Gather your votes
  - Once you get enough votes, the দাবি is formalized
  - We then take the দাবিs to the right changemaker to get you an answer!`
    },
    {
      question: "Who can submit a দাবি?",
      answer: "Any registered user can submit a দাবি. We encourage all citizens to participate in the process of improving Bangladesh."
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from change.org?",
      answer: `
  - We verify all users with your mobile phone numbers and OTPs
    - We will eventually verify you with NID verification
    - This means, unlike Change.org, only legitimate citizens can vote
  - We will take the top দাবিs to the right changemaker

  
  [Change.org](http://change.org) is global and passive, [Jonogon.org](http://jonogon.org) is local and active. We love Change.org, and took a lot of inspiration from there!`
